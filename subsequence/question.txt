Q: Write an algorithm to find all increasing subsequences of a given array,
 where the subsequences must follow specific rules. Each element in the subsequence should appear in the array only once.
 Find all increasing subsequences of a given array and return the list of these subsequences.

Example:
    Input Array: [4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1]
    Input: Subsequence: [4, 9, 1]
    Output Expected: True
