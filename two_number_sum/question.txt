Two Number Sum

Q:  Write a function twoNumberSum that takes in an array of integers (nums) and an integer target sum (target). 
The function should find two distinct integers in the array that sum up to the target sum and return them in an array in any order.
If no such pair exists, the function should return an empty array.

Example: 
Input: nums = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6], 
Target = 10 
Output: [-1, 11] (since -1 + 11 = 10)
